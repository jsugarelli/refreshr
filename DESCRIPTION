Title: Work with Refreshable Datasets that Update their Data Automatically
Description: Connects dataframes/tables with a remote data source. Raw data downloaded
  from the data source can be further processed and transformed using data preparation 
  code that is also baked into the dataframe/table. Refreshable dataframes can 
  be shared easily (e.g. as R data files). Their users do not need to care about
  the inner workings of the data update mechanisms.
